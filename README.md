##C++

###STACK
  stack <int> st;
  
  push : A push_back call is made to the underlying container.
      For vector, time complexity will be amortized (O(n)).
      For list, time complexity will be constant.
      For deque, time complexity will be constant.
  pop : A pop_back call is made to the underlying container. The time complexity for pop_back on any of the three types of containers we had discussed is constant.
  top : constant.
  size : constant.
  empty : constant.
  


##JAVA

###STACK
  Stack<data type> stack_name = new Stack<>();
  
  push() for inserting elements
  pop() for removing and returning the top element
  peek() for accessing the top element without removal
  search() for finding the position of an element
  empty() for checking if the stack is empty.
